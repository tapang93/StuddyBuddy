MUST HAVE xampp installed and also have apache and mysql local servers running.

right now i have the current files linked to my localhost, i dont know if it's the same for you.

once you pull all the php files and the folders included, you must save it into C:\xampp\htdocs\StuddyBuddy --Note: you must create the StuddyBuddy folder.

if you are able to run the php files, you are able to register and have the data stored in mysql.
